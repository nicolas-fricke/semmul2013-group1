\section{Context-related and Visual Clustering}
\label{sec_inhalt}

nodes are generally large, somewhat semantically homogenous but very visually diverse. Therefore: create finer clusters within each node.

\subsection{General Approach}
clustering all images visually is expenisve
semantics more important for humans

\subsection{Keyword Clusters}
good for context(?), outlier identification, basic clustering for part-meronym spanned trees (africa example)

\subsubsection{Keyword Clustering}
MANDY
\subsubsection{Assigning Images to Keyword Clusters}


\subsection{Visual Clusters}

\subsubsection{Features}
color  histogram, edge length and angle histogram \\
easy to calculate, obvious / humanly comprehensible, no need for complex features since only refinement of semantics (not trying to distinguish concepts by visual features)

\subsubsection{Clustering}
k-means seperately for colors and edges with k chosen by rule of thumb \\
feature vectors are pyramidal slices (up to 5)
late fusion by intersecting
