\section{Semantic and Visual Clustering}
\label{sec_inhalt}

The nodes received through the tree-based search are potentially very large (i.e., many pictures were found for the node). We found a rather small semantic and a large visual diversity within these nodes. It is therefore appropriate to refine especially the large nodes into smaller clusters.

\subsection{General Approach}
Since semantics are more perceivable to humans, and thus likely to be more important for our the given case, the refinement is done first on a semantic and then on a visual basis. That is, the results from the groups with semantically similar pictures are clustered again into subclusters with visually similar pictures. The steps are explained in more detail in sections \ref{sec_keywordclustering} and \ref{sec_visualclustering}.
This approach has the additional advantage that outlier images, which have been assigned to a node but do not quite fit with the others because they show something different, can be filtered out in the semantic step. \\
The resultig overall process is depicted in Figure \ref{fig_overallprocess}. \todo{explanation}

The data structures used in the process, such as Image Lookup Structures and Visual Feature Vectors, need only be calculated once for each image set. The preparational processes are visualized by Figure \ref{fig_precalcprocess}.

\subsection{Keyword Clusters}
\label{sec_keywordclustering}
good for context(?), outlier identification, basic clustering for part-meronym spanned trees (Africa example)

Use MCL graph clustering algorithm\cite{Dongen1998} \todo{basic explanation of mcl algorithm}.\\
graph nodes are Synsets, edges their co-occurrence
\bigskip
for each image, count how many synsets it shares with each cluster, and assign it to maximum (can be multiple)\\
if only one image falls into a keyword cluster, consider it an outlier

\subsection{Visual Clusters}
\label{sec_visualclustering}

One difficulty in the visual part of our work, besides the choice of appropriate features and their implementation, is the question how to use them jointly in a suitable algorithm for clustering. 

\subsubsection{Features}
Features finally chosen are:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Color histogram} in HSV color space with 20 bins each
\item{Edge histogram} lengths and angles, histograms with 10 bins (i.e., separation into 10 angles, with count of edges and sum of lengths for each) as combined vector \todo{look up structure of edge histogram}
\\
For edge histogranm extraction we use the EdgeHistogramFeatureExtractor class from the SimpleCV library. Referring to the official SimpleCV documentation \todo{reference: http://simplecv.sourceforge.net/doc/SimpleCV.Features.html}  the method creates both a 1 dimensional edge length histogram and a 1 dimensional edge angle histogram. Therefore it takes an image, applies an edge detector and calculates length and direction of lines in the image. The parameter number of bins is used to define which and how many line directions are taken in consideration.  
\end{itemize}
The reasons we chose these are that they are easy to calculate, rather obvious and humanly comprehensible. Since the purpose of this visual clustering is only in refining the semantic clusters, and not in trying to distinguish concepts by visual features, there is no apparent need for the use of more complex features \\
visual clustering as a refinement for the semantic clustering, therefore basic visual features seemed sufficient 
\todo{Can we explain or prove that somehow?} 


\subsubsection{Clustering}
A first, rather naive approach to clustering the visual characteristics extracted would be to concatenate the feature vectors (histograms), and apply one of the established clustering algorithms like k-means. \index{K-Means} The fact that remains unseen in this approach is that, generally, the values of different features are usually measured on different scales and therefore vary in their orders of magnitude: In color histogram, each bin's value represents a number of pixels, whereas in edge histograms the number of edges is counted, which is significantly smaller. \\
This circumstances influences any algorithm based on the distance between two images. Since differences in the larger values will usually be larger in its absolute value, they will also be more influential to the overall distance than the dimensions with smaller values.

So, instead, we decided to apply k-means separately for colors and edges, and join the results later through \emph{late fusion}\index{Late Fusion}, as explained below. As no specific criteria exist for the number of clusters that should be achieved, k is chosen by the established rule of thumb: $ k = \sqrt{n} $ \todo{reference to rule of thumb}, where n is the number of items to be clustered. K-means was chosen over hierarchical clustering, because it provided more well- and equally-sized clusters, the latter often just split off single images.\\
Initially, we planned to use an adaptive k, that is, start with a small k and increase it until the error (mean distance from centroids). Despite its higher computation complexity, it provides no better results than the rule of thumb. For example in color clustering, the adaptive approach will often just separate black and white images from colored ones.\\
For feature extraction, we use a pyramidal appraoch similar to the one proposed in \cite{Lazebnik2006}. Its advantage is that ... \todo{Explain advantages of pyramidal feature extraction}\\
Same paper also states the appropriateness of this method especially in refining existing clusters.\\
We combine the single-feature clusters by intersecting them, which is a simple and performant late fusion method \index{Late Fusion}. It ensures that all images within a cluster are similar in color as well as edge structure and leads to less or equal to $ 2\sqrt{k} $ subclusters.
