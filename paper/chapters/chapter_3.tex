\subsection{Constructing a Searchtree}
two typical types 
use hyponym relation to span tree of specializations \\
if no hyponyms (usually the case for geographic terms), use part-meronyms \\

\subsection{Synset Detection}
for each tag and word in title \\
preprocessing: remove all tags with numbers, split at special characters
try to find synset (limiting ourselves to nouns) \\
problem: multiple possible synsets for a word, how to find correct meaning? \\
use best-first search with limited queue, distances are based on Leacock and Chodorows Normalized Path Length (lch similarities, which is perceived as closer to human understanding than regular path similarity \cite{budanitsky01} )

\subsection{Assigning Pictures to Tree Nodes}
for higher recall: find strongly co-occurring tags that could not be mapped to synset \\
take all pictures that are annotated with the synset representing this node or at least one of the co-occurring tags
