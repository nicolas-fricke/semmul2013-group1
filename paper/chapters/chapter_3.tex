\label{sec_wordnetsearchtree}

\subsection{Wordnet}
Related to the offical web page WordNet is described as a freely and publicly available "large lexical database of english nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs, grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept." (ref: http://wordnet.princeton.edu/). Synsets are semantically linked with each other e.g. hyponyms and meronyms relations. 

network of synsets for discovering semantics between words \\
  

\subsection{Constructing a Searchtree}
two typical types 
use hyponym relation to span tree of specializations \\
if no hyponyms (usually the case for geographic terms), use part-meronyms \\

\subsection{Synset Detection}
for each tag and word in title, try to find synset (limiting ourselves to nouns) \\
problem: multiple possible synsets for a word, how to find correct meaning? \\
use best-first search with limited queue

\subsection{Assigning Synsets to Pictures}
for higher recall: find strongly co-occurring tags that could not be mapped to synset \\
take all pictures that are annotated with at least
