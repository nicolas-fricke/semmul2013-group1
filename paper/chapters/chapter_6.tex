\todo{Are our results good? Are they biased by something?}

All depends on annotations - inappropriate tagging leads to bad results, as well as limitation to nouns (adjectives, adverbs and verbs are wrongly matched nouns) \\

\subsection{Testset Quality}
different defintions of food, number of participants representative? Maybe difference between question (does it show food?) and what results people expect (would you want this as a result when searching for food?) \\
pictures often contain small items and cooked meals, so it's hard for a viewer to know what is contained. On the other hand, cooked meals with tomato in them should  not necessarily be clustered with tomato fruits. \\
No definition of visual similarity, so again question of representativity. plus, people may tend to find things less visually similar when they are semantically far apart

\subsection{Semantic Clusters}
MCL based clusters highly depend on quality of keyword clusters. Hard to evaluate, cannot be isolated.\\


\subsection{Visual Clusters}
also rather hard to look at in isolation, because method specifically designed for final subclustering. But lack of data for evaluation within subclusters for appropriately sized semantic clusters
