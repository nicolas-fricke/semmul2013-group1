\section{Related Work}
\label{sec_relatedwork}

Much research been done recently in image clustering and semantic clustering, with application areas in image segmentation, compact representation of large image sets, search space reduction and avoiding the semantic gap in content based image retrieval ($http://www.cscjournals.org/csc/manuscript/Journals/IJIP/Finalversion/Camera_ready_IJIP-304.pdf$) \\
However, most of this work presents new algorithms for one of the above use cases, not methods to retrieve training data \\

\subsection{Semantic Clustering and Tags}

Current issues with tag-based search and clustering, are related to the lack of a defined tag vocabulary (e.g. the use of synonyms, homonyms, variations in spelling etc.), and elaborated on more closely in \cite{Auer2011}

Ideas exist to use visual features to semantically analyze and classify images. \cite{Liu2007} and \cite{Zhang2012} provide good summaries and evaluations of the different approaches how this could be done. Both conclude that this so-called \emph{Automatic Image Annotation} \index{Automatic Image Annotation} is computation-intensive and not yet fully mature.

One alternative approach is $http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007 2Fs11042-008-0247-7.pdf$, which tries to annotate images (with a defined vocabulary?) based on visual features and existing tags, so-called \emph{folksonomies}.
