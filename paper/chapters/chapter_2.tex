\section{Related Work}
\label{sec_relatedwork}

Much research been done recently in image clustering and semantic clustering, with application areas in image segmentation, compact representation of large image sets, search space reduction and avoiding the semantic gap in content based image retrieval ($http://www.cscjournals.org/csc/manuscript/Journals/IJIP/Finalversion/Camera_ready_IJIP-304.pdf$) \\
However, most of this work presents new algorithms for one of the above use cases, not methods to retrieve training data
