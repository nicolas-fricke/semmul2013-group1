\section{Related Work}
\label{sec_relatedwork}

Much research has been done recently in image clustering and semantic clustering, with application areas in image segmentation, compact representation of large image sets, search space reduction and avoiding the semantic gap in content based image retrieval \cite{Lim2011}. \\
However, most of this work focuses on new algorithms for one of the above use cases, not on methods to generate training data. \\

One algorithm for retrieving training data for image analysis is presented in \cite{Orendovici2010}. The algorithm collects training data for computational analysis of the quality of photographs from Flickr. But, instead of analyzing pictures automatically according to their tags and comments, the paper presents a tool for collecting user votes. Comments were only used to retrieve terms for describing image quality.

Some of the closely related subjects like Semantic Clustering and Content-Based Image Retrieval are presented in this chapter.

\subsection{Semantic Clustering and Tags}
The idea of clustering search results based on tags and other annotations has been implemented before by \cite{Ramage2009} but for web pages instead of images. The main difference is that documents such as web pages consist of words, so their content itself can be used for semantic analysis.
Current issues with tag-based search and clustering are mostly related to the lack of a defined tag vocabulary (e.g. the use of synonyms, homonyms, variations in spelling etc.), and elaborated on more closely in \cite{Auer2011}.

There are already some approaches using WordNet for finding semantic similarities between different words, like \cite{richardson1994using}. They motivate using a knowledge base like WordNet to deal with general problems of the natural language. This means facing different meanings of a word and strong relations between different words. With the help of a hierarchical concept graph (HCG), consisting of hyponymns and meronyms for a specific entity, the semantic similarity between different words can be determined. In conclusion, the main challenge is to have a very accurate sense disambiguator which automatically and correctly assign words to their WordNet meaning. The existence of such a tool is indispensable for all classification approaches and they analyzed the WordNet semantic tagger as very promising.

Another approach is using a WordNet-based clustering technique for text documents, which is described in \cite{sedding2004wordnet}.  They tried to solve the problem of synonyms and ambiguity of words within texts, while adding a part-of-speech tag to every word based on knowledge provided by WordNet. Unfortunately the found out, that including synonyms and hypernyms does not improve the effectiveness of clustering, which they mainly relate to noise which comes with incorrect word interpretation of WordNet.

\subsection{Image Annotation and Content-Based Image Retrieval}

Ideas exist to use visual features to semantically analyze and classify images. \cite{Liu2007} and \cite{Zhang2012} provide good summaries and evaluations of the different approaches how this could be done. Both conclude that this so-called \emph{Automatic Image Annotation} \index{Automatic Image Annotation} is computation-intensive and not yet fully mature.

One approach that combines semantics and visuals to analyze pictures in a so called \emph{visual folksonomy} is \cite{Lindstaedt2009}. The idea is trying to annotate images, with a controlled vocabulary, based on visual features and existing tags. Their goal, however, is to create additional annotations for not or poorly tagged images. \\
Another approach is presented by \cite{cai2004hierarchical} with the aim to cluster images returned by a WWW image search. In contrast to pictures from a folksonomy, image search results are connected to a web page with context and link information which is used by the algorithm to cluster images.
