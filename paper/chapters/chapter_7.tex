\todo{How to improve, what other approaches to take}

\subsection{Semantic}
use more or other WordNet relations\\
improve keyword clusters by re-clustering large clusters\\
better synset detection (still see faulty recognition of tags), use groups and albums additionally, description with named-entity recognition \\
use different approach apart from WordNet as a knowledge base like DBpedia \footnote{http://dbpedia.org/About}

\subsection{Visuals}

use of high level features: would it improve the implemented visual clustering?
