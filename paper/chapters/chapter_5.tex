\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec_evaluation}

We evaluated our tool on a set of 9,201 images, which are a subset of the 1 million images of the MIRFLICKR-1M\footnote{http://press.liacs.nl/mirflickr/} file set, and the query term ``food''. Since no comparable algorithms exist, the evaluation is mainly aimed at obtaining the best values for the parameters and at providing a basis for comparison of further improvements and future work.

\subsection{Test set}
\label{sec_testset}
No gold standard is available to tell us which pictures show food and how similar the images are. The creation of such standards and training data is exactly the task we want to facilitate with this work.\\ 
To test the quality of our algorithm, we wrote a tool allowing us a crowdsourced generation of the needed reference data by the general public. This was achieved in two phases:\\

First, the users were shown random picture out of the 9,201 test set images and asked whether it shows food or not. We normalized these answers, so that there is only one vote per user per picture. In the case a user rated a picture multiple times, the value is determined by the ratio of positive (\emph{``shows food''}) and negative (\emph{``does not show food''}) votes of each user on one picture. We consider all those images as showing food that received at least 50\% positive votes. With over 35,000 clicks by more than 20 participants, 1,142 images out of the total 9,201 images were identified to show food. \\

Since data on the semantic and visual similarity of these pictures is also necessary for the evaluation, in the second phase, the users were shown pairs of images, on which we knew from phase 1 that they contain food, and asked to compare them. They could choose between three levels of semantic similarity: \emph{not similar}, \emph{same object}, and \emph{same object and same context}, and two levels of visual similarity: \emph{similar}, and \emph{not similar}.\\
Among the 12,962 votes of more than 30 participants were 757 pairs of images with same objects, 345 pairs with same object and same context, as well as 1,854 pairs of visually similar images. Multiple votes on one pair were rare (39 cases), and therefore simply not taken into account if they contradicted each other.

\subsection{Quality Indicators}
The evaluation focuses on the following four main aspects of our algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Retrieval of matching images
\item Semantic hierarchy and clusters
\item Visual clustering
\end{enumerate}

We measure the quality of the image retrieval (\emph{1.}) by calculating the F-Measure for the returned pictures, comparing our algorithm's result to the crowdsourced generated test set of phase 1. 

The quality of the hierarchy of the retrieved images (\emph{2.}) is based on the \emph{same object} and \emph{same object and context} pairs: The  minimal path distance for an annotated pair of pictures can be calculated and used to determine the closeness of two images: \[closeness(x,y) = 1/distance(x,y)\] Averaging this value over all pairs of a similarity category returns a value between 0 and 1 (below referenced as $c_o$ for same object pairs, $c_c$ for same object and same context pairs, and $c_n$ for not similar pairs), with the optimal values being 1 for positive (similar) pairs, and 0 for negative (non-similar) pairs. 
We include the keyword clustering in this evaluation by handling the clusters in a node as its children. Consequentially, the perfect score of 1 can only be reached when two semantically similar images are not only in the same node but also in the same semantic subcluster.

Visual similarity (\emph{3.}) is evaluated on the whole test set, because not enough comparison data is available to get valuable results if only comparisons within semantic clusters were used. Once again, F-Measure is used as indicator.

\subsection{Results}
\label{sec_results}

\subsubsection*{Image Retrieval}

Our image retrieval has a precision of 50.2\% and recall of 85.9\% on the ``food'' query, before execution of the semantic clustering that removes outliers. Without the use of co-occurring tags described in section \ref{sec_picturestonodes}, both values show no significant difference with p = 50.5\% and r = 85.4\%.
After the semantic clustering, the measures depend on the  parameters \emph{minimal node size}, \emph{mcl clustering threshold}, and \emph{minimal mcl cluster size}, described in sections \ref{sec_picturestonodes} and \ref{sec_keywordclustering}. The results for different values of these parameters are presented in table \ref{tab_retrievalevaluation}.\\

\begin{table}[h]
   \begin{tabular}{| p{2.2cm}| p{2.2cm}| p{2cm} || p{2cm} | p{2cm} | p{2cm} |}
    \hline
    \emph{mcl clustering threshold} & \emph{minimal mcl cluster size} & \emph{minimal node size} & \emph{precision} & \emph{recall} & \emph{f-measure} \\ \hline

\end{table}


\subsubsection*{Semantic Hierarchy and Clusters}

The results of the semantic hierarchy and cluster evaluation also depend on the parameters mentioned for image retrieval. The measurements listed in table \ref{tab_treeevaluation} indicate that the best distinction between images showing the same objects and images showing different objects is achieved with low \emph{minimal mcl cluster size}, that is, without outlier removal. The other parameters' values correlate with those of the image retrieval evaluation above.\\

\begin{table}[h]
    \begin{tabular}{| p{2.2cm} | p{2.2cm} | p{2cm} || p{1.4cm} | p{1.4cm} | p{1.4cm} | p{1.4cm} |}
	\hline    
    \emph{mcl clustering threshold} & \emph{minimal mcl cluster size} 	& \emph{minimal node size} & $c_o $ & $c_c$ & $c_n$ & $c_o - c_n$ \\ \hline
    0 	& 0 	& 0 & 0.25075 & 0.25483 & 0.23430 & 0.01645 \\ \hline
    0 	& 5 	& 0 & 0.25707 & 0.26691 & 0.24857 & 0.00850 \\ \hline
    5 	& 5 	& 5 & 0.26129 & 0.27160 & 0.25347 & 0.00782 \\ \hline     
    15 	& 25 &  5 & 0.24118 & 0.24927 & 0.23345 & 0.00773\\ \hline
    15 	& 0 & 15 & 0.27757 & 0.28242 & 0.25897 & 0.01860 \\ \hline
    15 	& 10 & 15 & 0.28285 & 0.29194 & 0.26884 & 0.01401 \\ \hline
    15 	& 25 & 15 & 0.28571 & 0.29391 & 0.27563 & 0.01008 \\ \hline
    	100 	& 100 & 100 & 0.32578 & 0.34126 & 0.31711 & 0.00867 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Semantic quality measures}
	\label{tab_treeevaluation}
\end{table}

It can generally be observed that varying the parameters most strongly influences the amount of the closeness measures, that is, all their values rise or drop somewhat consistently.
